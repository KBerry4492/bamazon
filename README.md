The Store inventory will be displayed.
Select [SHOP] or [EXIT].

Shop will open a prompt to select the item you wish to purchase.
After you select an item, you will be prompted to input how many you wish to purchase.

If there is sufficient inventory, then the transaction will go through, informing you how much you have spent and how many items remain in stock.

If not, then you will be informed as such and returned to the home screen.
